			   UDP Samplicator		-*- text -*-
			   ===============

This small program receives UDP datagrams on a given port, and resends
those datagrams to a specified set of receivers.  In addition, a
sampling divisor N may be specified individually for each receiver,
which will then only receive one in N of the received packets.

				USAGE

The usage convention for the program is

	$ samplicate [<option>...] [<destination>...]

Where each <option> can be one of

	-d <level>	to set the debugging level
	-s <address>	to set interface address on which to listen
			for incoming packets (default any)
	-p <port>	to set the UDP port on which to listen for
			incoming packets (default 2000)
	-b <buflen>	size of receive buffer (default 65536)
	-c <configfile>	specify a config file to read
	-x <delay>	to specify a transmission delay in units of
			microseconds
	-S		maintain (spoof) source addresses
	-n		don't compute UDP checksum (only relevant with -S)
	-f		fork program into background
	-m <pidfile>	write the process ID to a file
	-h		to print a usage message and exit

and each <destination> should be specified as
<addr>[/<port>[/<interval>[,ttl]]], where

	<addr>		IP address of the receiver
	<port>		port UDP number of the receiver (default 2000)
	<freq>		number of received datagrams between successive
			copied datagrams for this receiver.
	<ttl>		The TTL (IPv4) or hop-limit (IPv6) for
			outgoing datagrams.

Config file format:

  a.b.c.d[/e.f.g.h]: receiver ...
where:
  a.b.c.d		is the senders IP address
  e.f.g.h		is a mask to apply to the sender (default 255.255.255.255)
  receiver		see above.

Receivers specified on the command line will get all packets, those
specified in the config-file will get only packets with a matching source.
